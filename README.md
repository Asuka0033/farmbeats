Microsoft FarmBeats Student Kit
===============================

Welcome to the Microsoft FarmBeats Student Kit repo here on GitHub.

### Challenge

To help farmers meet increasing demands on their farms, they need to optimize
their crops and maximize returns while preserving resources like water and soil.
Precision agriculture is one practice that helps farmers to observe, measure and
respond to variabilities with these goals in mind.

### Solution

The Microsoft FarmBeats Student Kit is a tool to help enable data-driven
farming. We believe that data, coupled with the farmer’s knowledge and intuition
about their farm, can help increase farm productivity, and also help reduce
costs.

Designed to get you up and running easily this Internet of Things (IoT) kit
includes preconfigured Microsoft Azure cloud services and a Raspberry Pi with
soil moisture, light, ambient temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure
sensors to collect data that can provide insights to help you understand how to
improve productivity, increase yield, and save resources.

The Microsoft FarmBeats Student Kits are easy-to-use solutions that help
students learn about precision agriculture and Internet of Things (IoT)
technologies.

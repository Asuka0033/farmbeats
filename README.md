Microsoft FarmBeats Student Kit
===============================

Welcome to the Microsoft FarmBeats Student Kit repo here on GitHub.

The Microsoft FarmBeats Student Kits are easy-to-use solutions that help
students learn about precision agriculture and Internet of Things (IoT)
technologies.

The Microsoft FarmBeats Student Kits are tools to help enable data driven
farming. We believe that data, coupled with the farmer’s knowledge and intuition
about their farm, can help increase farm productivity, and help reduce cost.

Kits:

-   [Indoor
    M1](https://github.com/farmbeatslabs/studentkit/blob/master/Indoor-m1/readme.md)
    – Raspberry Pi + Light, Soil, Temp, Humidity, Pressure sensors.

We would love to hear from you for any successes or failures you experience
along the way.

We hope you enjoy using the kits.

The FarmBeats Student Kit team!

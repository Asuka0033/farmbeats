    -   If you have received your Student Kit from your school or other
        educational organization then it’s likely that you would have a
        customized registration process. E.g. <https://aka.ms/fbsk-schoolname>

    -   If you have received your Student Kit independent of an educational
        organization then just use the base URL of <https://aka.ms/fbsk>

-   To login for the first time click either the Login or the Activate Your Kit
    button on the home page. Note: In the top right of the page it will show if
    you are logged in already. If you are already logged in with an account that
    you don’t want to use for the Student Kit then log out and visit the page
    again.
